## Iptables (Lab 2.1)   
### Create a new custom chain  
```text
$ iptables -N <chain_name>  
```  
  
### Make sure all incoming traffic is processed by <chain_name> before it is processed by RH-Firewall-1-INPUT  
```text
$ iptables -I INPUT 1 -j <chain_name>  
```  
  
### Save your work  
```bash
$ service iptables save
```  
  
### Current observations  
RH-Firewall-1-INPUT is 'lost', _no clue_ where the fuck it goes, but it disappears from ```$ iptables -L -v -n``` and ```/etc/sysconfig/iptables```.
