# RHCSA Level Security Options

## Security Concepts
+ Basic File Permissions
+ Access Control Lists
+ Firewall Control
+ Security-Enhanced Linux

## Basic File Permissions
Sticky bit: The `s` in the execute bit for the owner of the file is the SUID bit. It means that the file can be executed by other users with the authority of the file owner.  
The concept is the same for GSUID.  

## umask
(Not writing about umask right now)

## Special File Attributes
Can help control what any one user is able to do with a given file. `chattr` and `lsattr` to change and view the attributes.  
File attributes:  

|Attribute|Description|
|---|---|
|append only (a)|Prevents deletion, but allows appending|
|no dump (d)|Disallows backups using the `dump` command|
|extent format (e)|Set with the ext4 filesystem; __cannot__ be removed|
|immutable (i)|Prevents deletion or any other kind of change to a file|
|indexed (I)|Set on directories for indexing with hash trees; __cannot__ be removed|

## Access Control Lists
It is necessary to mount the filesystems with acl support.  
```text
# mount -o remount, acl /dev/sda3 /home
```
To make it permanent, add it to `/etc/fstab`:
```text
/dev/sda3    /home    ext3    defaults,acl    1,2
```
The `gefacl` command can be used to retrieve the ACL for a given file:
```text
# getfacl /home/examprep/TheAnswers
```
The `setfacl` command can be used to set the ACL for a given file:
```text
# setafcl -m u:user:rwx /home/examprep/TheAnswers
```
It can also be used to remove privileges:
```text
# setfacl -x u:user /home/examprep/TheAnswers
```
Description of File Permissions:

|Switch|Description|
|---|---|
|-b (--remove-all)|Removes all ACL entries; regains standard ugo/rwx permissions|
|-k|Deletes default ACL entries|
|-m|Modifies the ACL of a file|
|-n (--mask)|Omits the mask in recalculating permissions|
|-R|Applies changes recursively|
|-x|Removes a specific ACL entry|

Can also be used to __restrict__ access:
```text
# setfacl -m u:guest:--- /etc/passwd
# setfacl -R -m u:guest:--- /etc
```

Masking:
```text
# setfacl -m mask:r-- /home/examprep/TheAnswers
user:user:rwx    #effective:r---
```

## NFS and ACLs
Linux administrators should know this. The ACLs can be retrieved via the command `nfs4_getfacl`.  
Description of NFSv4 ACL Permissions:

|Permission|Description|
|---|---|
|r|Read file or list directory|
|w|Write to a file or create a new file in a directory|
|a|Append data to a file or create a subdirectory|
|x|Execute a script or change a directory|
|d|Delete the file or directory|
|D|Delete the subdirectory|
|t|Read the attributes of the file or directory|
|T|Write the attributes of the file or directory|
|c|Read the ACLs of the file or directory|
|C|Write the ACLs of the file or directory|
|y|Sinchronize the file or directory|

## Standard Ports

|Port|Description|
|---|---|
|21|FTP|
|22|SSH|
|23|Telnet|
|25|SMTP|
|53|DNS|
|80|HTTP|
|88|Kerberos|
|110|POP3|
|139|NetBIOS|
|143|IMAP|
|443|HTTPS|

## IPTables

(Not going to write about iptables now)

## SELinux Standar Directives

|Directive|Description|
|---|---|
|SELINUX|Enforcing, permissive or disabled|
|SELINUXTYPE|targeted (daemons) or mls (Multi-Level Security)|  

## Configure regular users for SELinux

To review the status of current users, run `semanage login -l`.  
Regular users should be confined by SELinux.  
The following example confines `user` by specifying the role `user_u`:
```text
# semanage login -a -s user_u user
```

Role changes take effect on next login.  
To confine all future users:  
```text
# semanage login -m -S targeted -s "user_u" -r s0 __default__
```
Options for SELinux User Roles:

|User Role|Features|
|---|---|
|guest_u|No GUI, no networking, no access to the `su` or `sudo` commands|
|xguest_u|GUI, networking only via FF browser|
|user_u|GUI and networking available|
|staff_u|GUI, networking and `sudo` available|
|unconfined_u|Full system access|  

## SELinux boolean settings

A full list of booleans is available from the output of the `getsebool -a` command.

## List and identify SELinux file contexts

`ls -Z` will list the current SELinux contexts.  
The key file context is the type (httpd_t, admin_home_t, etc).  

To change the context, use the `chcon` command:
```text
# chcon -R -u system_u -t public_content_t /ftp
```
To allow uploads to this FTP server, the context needs to be changed to `public_content_rw_t`:
```text
# chcon -R -u system_u -t public_content_rw_t /ftp
```
The same can also be achieved by 'replicating' the permissions of another directory:
```text
# chcon -R --reference=/var/ftp /ftp
```

## Identify SELinux process contexts

To identify the context with which processes are running, the `ps -eZ` command can be used.

## Diagnose and address SELinux policy violations

The top three causes for SELinux related probems are: labelling, context and boolean settings.
