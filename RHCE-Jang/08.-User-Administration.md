```

Disallow access to __ALL__ users, except those who are members of the `wheel` group, along with the `shutdown` and `sync` users on the __LOCAL__ system:
```text
-:ALL EXCEPT (wheel) shutdown sync:LOCAL
```

## Users and network authentication
### LDAP client configuration
To configure a RHEL client as an LDAP client, the following packages are required:
+ openldap-clients
+ openldap
+ nss-pam-ldap

### /etc/pam_ldap.conf

|Directive|Description|
|---|---|
|host 127.0.0.1|Specifies the IP address for the LDAP server|
|base dc=example,dc=com|Sets the default __base__ distinguished name|
|ssl start_tls|Required if TLS support is used|
|pam_password|Supports encryption schemes for passwords|
|nss_init, groups_ignoreusers, root, ldap|Assumes no supplemental groups in the LDAP directory server|

In `/etc/ldap.conf`, add or modify:
```text
uri ldap://127.0.0.1
ssl no
tls_cacertdir /etc/openldap/cacerts
pam_password md5
pam_password exop
```

In `/etc/openldap/ldap.conf`, add or modify:
```text
URI ldap://127.0.0.1
HOST server1.example.com
BASE dc=example,dc=com
TLS_CACERTDIR /etc/openldap/cacerts
```
(The LDAP server might not be on the local system and the network domain might not be example.com. Modify accordingly)
