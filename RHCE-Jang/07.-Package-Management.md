(Not going to write up on this one)

## More RPM Commands
### Package Queries
The simplest RPM query verifies if a package is installed or not:
```text
# rpm -q <package>
```
Some additional queries:  

|Query Command|Description|
|---|---|
|rpm -qa|Lists all installed packages|
|rpm -qf /path/to/file|Identifies the package associated with /path/to/file|
|rpm -qc package|Lists only configuration files from __package__|
|rpm -qi package|Displays basic information for __package__|
|rpm -ql package|Lists __all__ files from __package__|
|rpm -qR package|Notes all dependencies|  

### Package signatures
To check the integrity of a package:
```text
# rpm --checksig <package>.rpm
```

### File Verification
The verification of an installed package compares information about that package with information from the RPM database on that system.  
Verify all files:
```text
# rpm --verify -a
```
Verify all files withing a package agains a downloaded RPM:
```text
# rpm --verify -p <package>.rpm
```
Verify a file associated with a particular package:
```text
# rpm --verify --file /bin/ls
```
Any output means that a file or package is different from the original. `rpm --verify` failure codes:

|Failure Code|Description|
|---|---|
|5|MD5 checksum|
|S|File size|
|L|Symbolic link|
|T|File modification time|
|D|Device|
|U|User|
|G|Group|
|M|Mode|

## Dependencies and the `yum` command
(Will not dwell into this right now)
